sentence,startTime
um today's content I'm super excited for so um Devin why don't you go ahead and introduce yourself and then we'll Dive,0:00
In everybody nice to meet you my name is Evan I oversee our expansion teams here,0:06
at drift um and been here about five years uh super excited to talk about how to sell,0:14
this c-suite faster we have an amazing list of uh people here to talk through,0:19
that with us today um before I pass over to Brooke one thing we want to get going in the chat,0:25
is um what is your biggest sales Outreach pet peeve so I want you all to think,0:31
about that um and put it into the chat and kind of go through and see what are some of the,0:38
trends that were we're seeing across the across the team and so um with that I'm gonna pass over to,0:43
Brooke first to introduce yourself and then we'll get to Katie and Ted I was just trying to think of what pet,0:50
peeve to add in I'll do that um I am Brooke I am a director of sales,0:55
at drift I work hand in hand with Evan my team is primarily new business we do,1:02
do a little bit of expansion but then we hand the accounts over to Evan's team to,1:07
take care of those customers for the long term uh so so that's my role and I,1:13
love doing these webinars it's fun to talk about this stuff I could do it all the time and happy to be here with,1:18
everyone I'll pass it to Katie thank you Brooke yeah hi everyone I'm really,1:24
excited to be here today I'm Katie and I can't executive at Outreach,1:29
um based out of London I saw in the chat we've got someone from Germany which I think is the closest to me that I've,1:34
seen here um yeah being at Outreach for about three years now done both an sdro and an,1:41
account executive role so yeah looking forward to sharing some perspectives on selling to the c-suite I'll pass it over,1:47
to 10 yeah great I'm seeing lots of pet peeves roll in I think it's funny we said the,1:54
biggest pet peeve that assumes that there's more than one for each of us but maybe that's a separate discussion hey,1:59
everyone Ted McKenna um I'm founding partner of a company called DCM insights we're a research company,2:04
um I also co-wrote a book called The jolt effect some of you might have heard uh recently with Matt Dixon you might,2:10
know from the Challenger sale days and so forth so excited to join the discussion today,2:15
awesome yeah and we are seeing some good pet peeves uh looks like no phone number no uh no ability to see,2:22
um account level intent that's a big one um so those are all things for sure as a,2:30
as any salesperson those would be uh tough things to kind of uh overcome,2:36
okay so the you know the first question we're,2:42
going to start off with this is the you know the understanding the most common pain points today for B2B Executives and,2:48
you know we were talking a little bit offline about this one Brooke um about some of the things that you're,2:53
kind of seeing in the field with reps and from talking to um to talking to a lot of Executives and,2:59
this kind of idea of consumption and a lot of um a lot of people buying technology and,3:05
so um wanted to kind of kick it up to you in terms of what you're seeing today and then obviously we'll kind of get,3:11
more perspective from Ted and Katie as well and we definitely are talking,3:16
directly with more c-level Executives than ever ever before I think in my,3:21
sales career I can't think of a time this number of c-level execs have been involved in a deal that is relatively,3:27
High Velocity you know these aren't deals that take a year to close um but they are deeply involved and I,3:35
think that the pain Point tied to those executive is being deeply involved has,3:42
to do with you know what we've seen in terms of the rate of purchasing,3:47
technology um you know for us at drift we're very deep in Tech uh SAS to be specific and,3:52
one of the biggest changes happen coming out of the pandemic,3:59
um you know there have been like this 10 plus year build up of tech purchasing and I don't know if you call it over,4:05
consumption but definitely heavy consumption um with the cloud and not long ago,4:11
anyone in any department at like director plus level had some budget that,4:17
they could largely spend without a ton of discussion or case building I'm not saying that it was easy on either side,4:22
for buyers or sellers but they you know had a lot of room to make decisions and they didn't necessarily have to go get,4:28
buy-in from other teams even if what they were purchasing maybe impacted those other teams and it could all,4:35
happen really fast and then that accelerated even more during the panda stomach and came coming out of that it,4:41
was almost like you know this hangover and that made its way to the sea level execs that we're talking to now as they,4:48
realized that you know their teams even with the best intentions had bought all this technology but there was under,4:55
utilization overlap of tools there was you know attacks on teams in terms of,5:01
bandwidth to get going on software um and so we sort of saw all of that,5:07
happening and we were watching at the sea level these execs sort of started start to untangle a lot of what had gone,5:12
on um and they still wanted to keep their teams moving fast right like there are a,5:20
lot of things that need to be purchased um but they had to start to smooth out what that evaluation process looked like,5:25
so they could make sure that you know everything was working at scale across all of their teams and that added a lot,5:33
more steps to the process um where you know now we are building more business cases,5:40
um we're talking to multiple departments and this all ties back to that pain point that the sea level has right now,5:46
which is I'm trying to keep my teams moving fast without over consuming and getting too tangled up with too many,5:53
vendors um so that's the biggest thing that I've seen lately Katie what about you I completely agree with you that Brooke,5:59
I think um I've also seen that a lot of companies have just got this excess in,6:06
their Tech stack and now as you said they've come to realize this and this sort of mandate of consolidation is,6:12
absolutely what I'm seeing as well um I think alongside this for a lot of we see sweets um the same kind of themes,6:18
keep on coming up so the team capacity has gotten tighter um budgets have been cut and they're,6:26
basically being asked to do more with less so the sort of themes that I keep on,6:33
saying is with this in mind how can we make sure that we're efficient and we're predictable and we're productive so I,6:39
think over the past few years there's been this real Mandate of just growth growth growth and growth at any cost but,6:46
it really seems now it's been clamped down and people are really striving for making sure that growth is profitable,6:52
which is really where efficiency comes in so yeah I think this all really does,6:57
feed back into your point around consolidation as well and just making sure that from both the rep level and a,7:03
technology stack everything is efficient and consolidated you're not in that Ted is that what,7:08
you're saying yeah totally I see tons a lot of overlap I mean so we just finished this giant giant study of uh,7:14
two and a half million sales conversations and indecision was the big thing that popped up I think you guys are making some really good points about,7:21
the evolution especially Tech purchases and how it's impacting how people are making decisions and I think you know,7:27
one difference we see now versus maybe two or three years ago is that it it now,7:34
it feels less likely we're going to move lose when we lose that we're going to lose to a competitor you know and more,7:40
likely we lose to no decision you know we're in the as in the past it's more about how different are we versus our,7:45
two or three big competitors because they're trying to decide who's best because I'm gonna spend money I just,7:51
need to figure out who I'm going to spend money with and now we see more and more deals dying to no decision and,7:57
specifically sort of indecision that they're they're gripped by and there's lots of evidence that that's on the rise,8:02
too for lots of secular reasons like one of the big reasons people to come to any decision is because,8:08
there's just so many options out there they get they get kind of stuck right or too much information out there that just paralyzes us all and that's not ending,8:15
right there's more information and more options out there every single day and so this is what we're hearing a lot is sort of,8:22
um decision makers in general and their teams really sort of just stalling out and and sort of gripped by indecision,8:28
should I move forward when should I move forward how should I move forward and so forth I think that's a really interesting,8:35
perspective and I think that ties in nicely to what you know Brook and Katie are both talking about which is you know you've seen this kind of growth this,8:41
like democratization of purchasing Within These companies um and there's more and more you know,8:47
we've all seen the list of our Tech lists and other lists as well of the amount of software companies is really,8:53
exploding right so you just have more and more to see more and more um options but that's not always,8:59
necessarily a good thing when it comes to you know actually making a decision or on the other side being a seller,9:04
where you not have to compete against a bunch of other players that maybe there is a massive amount of differentiation,9:10
in um Ted I think one more question there would be curious like how are like you know we've kind of talked about this,9:15
this pain Point around you know consolidation and um you know also leading to the,9:21
indecision because what companies have grown really quickly um how are you seeing you know these,9:26
Executives solve for that yeah well so on the sales side I think one is,9:32
kind of understanding that it's happening and by the way past persons regrets can feed a little bit this,9:38
indecision too right like who Among Us doesn't feel like you've been oversold or overbought you know in the past and,9:44
so those things can drive more hesitancy and more decision on this next,9:49
um on this next type of purchase we in the study we found lots of different,9:55
four specific behaviors that kind of address the indecision fears that buyers,10:00
have I mentioned two of them already the the third fear is outcome uncertainty so who who's who's ever uh felt this way no,10:05
matter how many case studies you send them no matter how many reference calls they've done no matter how many proof points you've given them they just still,10:13
don't feel like it's enough right like I I'll be the one exception so that's kind of the third fear is like you know how,10:19
much proof do you need like you know just like make that leap of faith I think Brooke makes a good point there's,10:26
less likely or less willing to make that leap of faith and so so what the best sellers do there's kind of four,10:31
techniques jolt is an acronym so yeah we want to jolt past a customer indecision but the,10:36
first one the J is a judging level of indecision so I have to understand and,10:43
measure the degree or the intensity of that indecision and incorporate it into,10:48
how I think about qualifying that opportunity or forecasting its likelihood to close the second one is,10:54
offering a recommendation that's the o so we can't just let the buyer on their,11:01
own decide is it this option or that option this configuration or that configuration this integration or that,11:06
can integration even after they believe that they should buy from you that they,11:11
want to buy they need to buy they still have lots of decisions they have to make to get to the point where they actually,11:17
transact so what the best sellers are doing is they're being more personal in making very specific recommendation of,11:22
this is the package this is the configuration um this is how to kind of think about this decision so that's offering a,11:29
recommendation the L is about limiting the expiration that kind of gets into that analysis paralysis that we know,11:35
buyers ask for it can be very tempting I think for a seller to get um sort of,11:41
head faked by the buyer who keeps wanting more demos right like can I have it just another demo and another and at,11:48
first it's like this is great they're loving it like they won't stop calling me they won't stop asking for it the high performers thinking hold on like,11:54
why wasn't the last demo enough like is there is it really the seventh demo is really going to change your decision calculus so we've got to find ways to,12:01
kind of limit that exploration and keep them into that sort of productive reasonable amounts of exploration so we,12:08
talk about kind of the techniques there and then the last one is taking risk off the table you know which sounds a little,12:14
bit obvious like in a situation when that buyer's grip to uncertainty I've got to find ways to make it feel less,12:19
risky give a little bit of decision protection some of this is just about setting the right expectations like being careful about when the buyer has,12:25
outsized expectations like they've they see that case study that looks like it's like the perfect scenario that's that,12:33
you know is like really difficult to replicate but that's what they start like pegging their Roi projections to and now it's hard to build consensus,12:39
around it's hard to get people to believe that that's going to actually happen and so simple expectation sending,12:46
can can make a difference but in the book we go into detail about what we call safety nets and the ways in which,12:51
we can offer additional safety protection which we don't do enough in B2B sales we can have a whole separate,12:57
conversation about that but that's the short version uh sorry of a 250 page book of kind of what the portions that,13:03
with respect to dealing with a decision yeah no that was great great cliff notes and I think just to kind of summarize a,13:09
little bit before I move into more of the the Tactical side I think the the common pain points around you know,13:15
proliferation of software you know a lot a lot of it not being used regrets over past decisions being made also impacting,13:20
decisions and then you know Katie was talking about doing more with less um certainly something that's on every executive's mind so I think that's a,13:27
that's a really good way to kind of frame the conversation for today so you know shifting gears a little bit to the,13:34
Tactical side um I think there's no one no one else better to kick us off there than you know someone uh who's seen a lot of,13:40
success as a um as a salesperson at Outreach which you know I think a lot of people uh Outreach is synonymous with,13:46
outbound so you know we kind of know the challenges that are happening today what they're dealing with um I think we had a good discussion,13:53
around that but Katie for you what does outbounding what is I guess what is,13:58
successful outbounding do the c-suite look like um yeah this is a really interesting,14:04
topic um I think the first thing to recognize here is that no matter what industry,14:09
you're in when you're out burning to the c-suite they are absolutely like inundated with prospecting messages just,14:15
like yours so a few pieces of advice to think about here so number one you've,14:23
obviously you've got to make yourself stand out like I said by the time they go into a meeting and then come back out,14:29
they might have 10 new emails from other sales reps also asking for 30 minutes of their time so one way that we quite like,14:35
to go about this is sending people personalized gifts so do your research,14:43
maybe they really like a sports team for example or like they went to a certain,14:48
college or university and being able to leverage that to send them things so one,14:54
example that we did with one of my target accounts last year was I think we,15:00
saw it on LinkedIn but this person really liked the uh the drink Guinness like pints of Guinness and so we got a,15:05
Guinness glass um got their name scratched into it carved into it and sent it to their office with like a really personalized,15:12
note attached and literally as we got the notification saying that it had been delivered there was an email coming,15:19
through from them because it's just breaking through that noise so I know that's kind of excessive but just any,15:25
little things you can do like that really really make you stand out um I am also a big believer,15:31
um outside of you know sending gifts to people the the quickest and the best way,15:39
to book a meeting is often on the phone um I think if you're picking up the phone and making cold calls to people,15:44
you're already above you know 80 90 of sales reps that aren't doing that and,15:51
that are just sending out emails to people so just from picking up the phone you're already giving yourself,15:56
advantages but obviously it is important to keep a multi-channel approach you,16:01
know sending emails LinkedIn messages and that kind of thing so if you are sending emails big tip here is send it,16:07
yourself on your iPhone first because chances are if you're speaking to a c-suite they're probably reading that,16:15
email on their phone as they're running between one meeting or another place in the office so just making sure they can,16:21
see it on their phone without having to scroll through multiple pages is also speaking in a language that works for,16:27
them I don't know if that seems uh similar to what you're doing drift Brook,16:33
it all it all sounds very relevant and like I always just think when you're thinking about this c-suite what do they,16:39
have the least of time so they don't have a lot of time to read what you're sending them to talk to you to take a,16:46
meeting um I'd avoid asking for 30 minutes actually right like in actuality you,16:52
probably want that c-suite individual to delegate you down to someone who can,16:59
start the conversation but now that door's open with a cro or CEO or whoever,17:04
it is that you have in your buying committee or you can come back around to them recap them you're not going to have,17:10
your initial exploratory call with them anyway so if you send a really brief to,17:15
the point well-researched email to the c-suite ask a question like get right to,17:20
the point but don't ask them for 30 minutes you're probably going to get a higher conversion rate I like your point,17:27
about um you know making it easy for them to look at it on their phone coming and going for meetings because that's the,17:32
reality of the day-to-day um but I I can't impress enough how,17:39
important research is and just knowing your audience um I think that all of us in sales get,17:44
into periods of time where we kind of like go through the motions where you know I'm going to send the same sort of,17:50
email to everyone because it worked um and then it stops working and we don't change so consider what you're,17:56
sending how brief it is and what you're asking for um when thinking about the c-suite just,18:03
to jump in there as well Brooke I love what you said that about not asking for 30 minutes or a big demo because it it,18:10
seems like a big ask and something hard to like buy into so something that we've been kind of a b testing and seeing work,18:15
is just open to learning some ideas as you'll sign up on your email and you,18:22
know it feels easy to buy into and like who's not open to just learning and picking up a few ideas so that's yeah,18:27
it's something we've just been see work I was aggressive sorry no I was just,18:33
going to say I think the the thing I heard from from both of you and this is kind of like from from your side to have,18:39
like the expectations piece right so when you engage with sea levels like that explication of their time and so I,18:45
think it ties in nicely to discussing earlier around you know what are your expectations for engaging with the c-level executive and like how do you,18:51
make it successful yeah totally I love the two to three minute thing but I think be careful like,18:56
when you get let's let's say that's successful make sure you keep it at two or three minutes because you you want to,19:01
like I'm throughout you want and by the way think about the trust you earn when that happens like you know that's part,19:07
of the reason they're hesitating to give you two minutes because they think what you really mean is 25 minutes but I'm just saying two minutes,19:12
um so I think that's really smart is trying to time box it I think you know think about like the the Brooke you made,19:17
a good point about like research and and what's going on with this specific industry and and sort of helping you,19:24
tailor that message I think about the meetings these people might have just come from when they're about to read that email like the tough budget meaning,19:30
where they're they're making hard decisions about layoffs you know to then open up an email and ask for a demo it,19:37
feels like it's a hard you know shift uh gear shift there and so you know putting,19:43
in just a little bit of detail about you know here's here's why this is important right now,19:48
um but but tailored in the lens of like your industry and what's going on there in that moment,19:53
100 I think um the you know these are all really good best practices and good,20:01
discussion around I think going back the expectations piece of you know,20:06
we're all being asked by our leadership everyone probably here on this call to get more sea levels involved in your,20:12
deals you know like I probably don't know a person who you go into a drv with or that's being important so,20:19
um understanding how you're going to do it why you're going to do it why they should care and then um you know I think the uh I've I've,20:26
typically found if you do a 30-minute conversation with the sea level they always show up what five to eight minutes late a lot of times it's because,20:33
they're running from meeting to meeting meeting if you can give them five minutes back um of their time and actually just take,20:39
25 minutes um that can go a long way to building that relationship with them where they feel they trust you and they see you as,20:44
that trusted advisor so um I think those are some really good um some good best practices that we're,20:50
seeing so we've talked about you know the what,20:56
executives are dealing with we've kind of talked about the a little bit of the problem segment um and then going to some good best,21:01
practices Katie kicked us off around how do you actually get in front of that person what are the things that work to help you cut through the noise and and,21:07
get their attention um now you have their attention you're hopping on a call so uh you know Ted,21:14
from your perspective you know monitoring a lot of sales calls a lot of modern a lot of sales reps over a long,21:22
long period of time um you know love to kick it off to you in terms of what you've seen work and we're poor building with the executive,21:27
uh to delete a successful Discovery call yeah I mean look Discovery is a,21:34
necessary but difficult thing and people have been trying to crack this code for for a long time and so I can't tell you,21:40
that we've we have the exact code to make it absolutely perfect uh but I have seen enough data and and listened to,21:46
enough calls to to tell you that you're better off if this feels like a two-way conversation than if it feels like uh,21:53
you're just extra you're just there to extract information from this person's brain um so what you'll hear often when people,21:59
talk about Discovery is the next word out of their mouth is questions you have to ask great questions and of course that's true but we should be following,22:05
up those questions in ways that either shares an Insight but I think more importantly just allows for some actual,22:12
back and forth discussion you know when you look at some of the high performer conversations that we looked in our study it feels almost like a I mean I,22:19
don't want to say a debate but kind of like a debate where you're you know you don't want to be combative so that's why I didn't want to use the word uh debate,22:27
but it does feel like there's there's even um comfort for some amount of overlap in,22:33
that discussion and and so that's that's what I would encourage people to think about or maybe there's a good question you can ask that allows for that type of,22:39
back and forth exchange or or sharing a piece of insight on the back end uh oh you know this I could my resonates with,22:46
me because this happens here in our organization just something to kind of get that discussion going,22:52
for sure um I think the understanding the Executive before you get to that,23:04
conversation is a big piece of big piece of this and I think um you know uh Kitty from from your side,23:09
you know again kind of being in the field every day getting ready for these conversations what are some of the things that you put in a place that help,23:16
you really nail that conversation with your first conversation with an executive yeah so I think we kind of touched on it,23:22
earlier but just doing your research is so important before you're getting on a call with an executive,23:31
um and just trying to find something above and beyond oh the weather's really bad today or where are you dialing in,23:37
from that they probably get asked on every single sales call that they joined if you can get on there knowing the you,23:43
know they like a sports team or they you went to the same University or,23:50
um even if there's not something really specific about them on their LinkedIn but you can see that their company has,23:55
just released a new product asked them about how that's going just so you can from the get-go,24:02
um you know they just they respect you more because they know that they're not just wasting their time and they're the next person in the revolving door of all,24:08
the prospects you're speaking to today there's a really kind of specific and intentional reason for speaking I think,24:15
that's just a great way for them to have that respect with you from the get-go,24:21
what are you thinking Brooke I'd add on to that that like you know at the end of the day a rapport is really about,24:27
relating to each other and so some ways to do that are like you know talk about,24:33
the kids talk about sports teams whatever that might be again the higher up you go,24:38
I think that sea level execs appreciate it when you understand their day-to-day so that Rapport building at the top of,24:44
the call can be as simple as like I know you have 25 minutes for this I totally get that talk about another two or three,24:52
CEOs or cros that you were talking to this week that were just like them that helps build some credibility for you too,24:59
because you do this all the time and now that like relationship is being built around you understanding the nature of,25:06
their job and the fact that they're on this call in the first place and that you're going to be tight you're going to get to business quicker than usual,25:13
they'll tell you if they want to chit chat right they'll push back and be like oh it's all right we can spend some time,25:19
but for the most part you'll build a lot of credibility up front by being a little bit more brief than you usually,25:24
are maybe with some other roles that you sell into um and I love the point about doing,25:31
research and knowing something relevant about their company that would take more than two clicks to figure out right so,25:37
not like what you see on their home page but what you see when you dig through something that their competitors are,25:43
doing or something in an earnings report that you can bring up that shows that,25:49
you can play at that same level that you're not um you know at a basic level and you should be on the call with them,25:54
yeah if it's a public company and you have you know earnings reports those are great places to look for that type of,26:02
information I love the notion of being of it being relatable as opposed like Rapport feels like a nebulous thing but,26:08
if I could just find a way to be relatable to you as an individual I think that's kind of the goal right,26:14
100 I think something I saw in the chat that I really liked was you know don't ask the discovery question that you can,26:20
Google uh or ask a question that you can Google that's pretty funny I think that's a,26:26
great framework um I feel like we all were we are we're coaching reps or you know we were reps,26:32
ourselves I think that that level of expectation that like being relevant with that buyers so it's so important I,26:39
think we have to realize as you're talking up the up the of the chain is the uh the the expectation they have for,26:45
you as a seller in terms of understanding their business it just gets more uh it just gets higher and higher I think and one thing Ted I'm,26:52
kind of curious to get your thoughts here is um you know given how much you've studied,26:59
sales reps over all you know a long period of time and and um you know setting behaviors and what,27:04
works um I think that that kind of like that Google question points really well to,27:10
um the the amount of information that's now out there about companies and about Executives think about LinkedIn like,27:16
like why someone got hired there's a lot of information on Google a few clicks away about these people like have do you,27:22
feel like when reps are hopping a discovery call those actually like expectations are,27:28
higher than maybe they were even like 10 years ago um that's a good question,27:33
I think the um I think it's a fair point to say that you know,27:39
yeah if you had spent five minutes Googling this you probably would have known this right and and more so than,27:45
five or ten years ago in part because we're all more Savvy with Google and more Savvy yes and there's tools like,27:52
Zoom info and others that you can go and find this information so it's less about like I think less of you because you,27:58
asked that question and more like you're wasting my time right right like and and my time is really valuable and now we're,28:05
like minute seven and you're asking me like things you could have so what why should I spend the next two minutes with,28:11
you if you've just wasted the first seven you know yeah totally um it's almost like you you those first,28:17
few minutes are critical to building up that trust uh to opening up that executive and maybe answer that question,28:24
or kind of yeah open up a little bit more about themselves what I think this kind of goes wrong is is I like that,28:29
Google question a lot I'm definitely going to steal that yeah that's a good one but um but it's also the templatized,28:35
you know Discovery where it's like I'm just you could go through the form and I'm just asking and so because of that,28:42
there's no real discussion on it I'm just getting the answer it's recorded great let me move to the next question,28:47
it's just like like what are we doing here like you could you could have sent this to me and I could have answered,28:53
over email if that's all you're looking for you know so that gets back to the discussion question we had earlier but I,28:58
think both of those things could do real damage to the again for me it's like you're trying to get that person to want,29:04
to spend more time on this problem necessarily with you but on this problem and so that's that's the frame of,29:09
reference it's like you don't waste my time right like earning earning that trust and being able to,29:15
um you know kind of like earn the right you know to get to get more time and Katie we talked about this a little bit,29:22
around like the value hypothesis and going into the conversation with that ready um and we've seen some really great,29:27
tactics even with our own teams of you know first time meeting with a CMO they'll send a video before that initial,29:33
conversation kind of warm up that person to talk through it by a hypothesis of what they've learned so far from the team,29:40
um are there um like I'd love to love you to talk a little more about the value hypothesis,29:46
side of this and like how that helps with the uh the discovery portion from what you're saying yeah so this is,29:51
something we've maybe been doing for like nine months or so now but when you've done that research previously,29:58
coming to that first meeting especially with the c-suite with a hypothesis slide,30:05
on from your research what you think might be going on so you know things,30:10
like they have just released they released a new product a few months ago maybe your hypothesis is that they're,30:16
really focused on upselling this to their existing customers it can be things that are pretty simple and you,30:23
know maybe wouldn't take a genius to work out but again that just really shows them that you aren't just,30:30
outbounding every single account hoping to get any leads you can find you've really again got that like intentional,30:36
reason for speaking to them um and just sometimes even from putting pretty basic things on it you get,30:42
reactions like wow were you in my internal meeting last week and that kind of thing which this kind of yeah goes,30:48
back to the Rapport question of how can we build that credibility as a seller I just think that's a great way to get off,30:55
hey can you bring a good point like I think the other thing I mean this might be maybe not the best audience to say,31:02
something this might be kind of controversial for you guys but like please do email automation is kind of,31:07
hurt on this because if you feel like I'm one of a hundred thousand people that just got this exact same email,31:13
it's like why why would I ever read anything else everything else you send me is going directly into the spam,31:19
filter you know so at least make it feel like you actually wrote it you know even if,31:24
it happens to be something that you have you're piping a lot of people,31:30
thank you so I guess I shouldn't blame the tech it's the person right and,31:36
yeah for sure completely agree with you there I think kind of mass blasting out the same email to everyone or getting on,31:44
a call and like you said as well earlier Ted like following the same script of questions for every single person you,31:51
speak to I don't think sales is a one-size-fits-all even if you are speaking to the same Persona every,31:57
engagement like you just need that personalized approach,32:03
great so we'll kind of we'll keep this moving here um so again we talk about problem statement we've talked about you,32:12
know where are some Tactics get in front of these people and then uh and we talked about once you have that conversation uh what are some of the,32:18
ways that you can make sure you make the most of it preparation was a big theme um you know we talked about uh the the,32:24
need to be um be uh relate to them right they understand be empathetic understand,32:30
their world um then make sure you kind of earn the right like I talked about earning the right to to get more time with them is,32:35
uh kind of a mentality to be thinking about is your process like that conversation um and so you know one thing we're all,32:42
being asked to get in front of more sea levels and and more people I think um one thing that's really challenging,32:49
as a sales rep is uh okay you get that meeting and uh like how do you keep that person,32:54
involved in the conversation uh you know as you're working you're typically working with their team and they maybe have some involvement there but um I,33:00
feel like there's a bunch of different theories on like how to do this well um but uh but Brooke maybe let's start,33:07
with you around um what have you seen work well how do you keep momentum once you have that person we know their time,33:12
is limited like how do you keep a how do you keep that sea level involved as you go through a sales process one of the,33:18
things that we've been working on over the last couple of quarters it's been going really well and you can actually see it in the close rates,33:23
um is to have the involvement at the executive level start with an intro from,33:30
our executive to their executive and so as the rep is starting to work on the deal our CEO or cro is reaching out,33:35
directly to that same level individual at the prospects company just a friendly,33:44
introduction opening the door making sure that there's a direct line of communication between those two and,33:49
letting them know that their our executive is like adding that executive know that they're aware that we're working with that company on an,33:55
evaluation at the same time in parallel the reps are working with multiple,34:02
contacts to multi-thread Across the organization and then as they're doing their Recaps they're sending much,34:07
briefer versions of that same recap back up to the C Level that we open the door,34:14
with through our RC levels so that they can be involved at an arm's length,34:20
because they aren't going to jump on every single call during the sales cycle they can't and they probably shouldn't they might jump back in at the end but,34:25
they won't be coming in cold without understanding of the value that we're providing the problems that we're solving and the outcomes that we're,34:32
looking for so that is like two quarters in progress and going pretty well I,34:38
recommend trying something like that and it also I think like the secondary benefit of it is it gets your c-suite,34:43
much closer to the deals in general and closer to the front line which is just good for the whole organization so,34:50
that's been going pretty well for us to just keep them engaged and keep that momentum one follow-up question there,34:57
you said something about getting more exposure to sea levels in your deal I think for most sales people you know I,35:04
felt this way probably certain points my career you know you're not sure if you want the zero to know about your deal,35:09
right how do you how do you convince your sales reps that this is like a good good idea I mean we're right now we're just,35:14
looking at the difference in close rates you know and every rep wants to close more deals so once you show that big of,35:20
a jump um you know when our execs are involved the close rate jumps up quite a bit so,35:27
that's a pretty easy win and I think just in general there's a good sense of Trust on our team,35:33
um from level to level I think uh we're very lucky at drift in that,35:39
um you know all of our reps are real team Sellers and don't see taking help from others as you know a sign that they,35:45
can't do it on their own or that they're not important um we really are much stronger when we,35:52
sell together so I think that's kind of like for us woven it a little bit into the fabric of how we do business we just,35:57
started to involve our our top top level execs a little bit more in the past couple quarters,36:05
how much is that there on the um the team selling approach which I think I agree is is a nice way to kind of,36:13
surround the the buyer organization you know we know there's going to be a bunch of sacrals that will weigh in and at the,36:19
end of the day this the senior level c-level individual they matter of course big time in terms of making that,36:26
economic decision but they often deferred their team and so we've got to find ways to spread our our bats I will,36:32
I would say they'll be careful a little bit about our research will tell you that when you do involve others uh and,36:39
you bring team members into that conversation how you do it matters uh quite a bit like you don't want to do,36:45
that as a way to sort of abdicate responsibility for the process where you're just bringing you know broke into,36:51
the conversation and Brooke take it away and then you sort of Go off into the recesses you've got it sounds kind of,36:57
like an obvious point but you've kind of got to orchestrate that moment bring that person into the conversation and,37:03
out if you don't you're going to get delegated down to the person you sound like right so if you so if you can't,37:09
answer those questions or you're starting to defer to others you can't be surprised then when the CC level person,37:14
wants to go around you uh the next time interesting point,37:20
yeah really interesting point I think what I'd add to that um I love the idea of getting your,37:27
exacts linked up on both sides um and definitely sending status updates,37:32
to keep them in the loop with what's going on in the sales process um something that I did quite recently,37:37
as well that worked quite well is as you said that book you know they're not going to want to sit through an,37:43
hour-long demo or watch an hour-long recording of every single feature in the platform so maybe if there is a you know,37:48
60 90 second key thing that's really going to have an impact on them,37:55
personally send a little snippet of just that one thing to keep them in the loop and kind of build that excitement and,38:00
almost tease them a little bit with what they could potentially be getting and seeing,38:07
um and just making sure that all of those touch points that you're sending out to c-suites are always really low,38:13
commitment low ask we're not asking for lots of time they're not having to read through loads of things it's just those,38:19
short sharp emails that aligns nicely with what a lot of people are putting in the chat this you,38:25
know approach of keeping them in the loop and making sure like you kind of set the tone of uh like kind of,38:31
somewhere Ted was saying that you've sang the tone around like we're going to keep you involved in the conversation and Katie has great those are great,38:37
tactical ways of ensuring that um low ask emails things like that I think it resonates really well with a lot of,38:43
people are saying um that that they've seen me successful too I'd also know when Katie was going,38:49
through that I think it's really smart and it feels like the if I were to caps on it it's like make it easy you know,38:55
for them yeah right man you're doing that in part because you're showing a Dem you're demonstrating that you,39:01
understand the process that's necessary to get from point A to point B right then you're you're engineering it you're,39:06
stewarding it you're keeping them involved but you're you're sort of making it feel very easy for them in the,39:12
process like that's a really great way to kind of keep involved another follow-up question here because,39:17
because I think it's an interesting we talk about team selling and the theme of um like it's kind of this not,39:24
contradiction but a little bit of like the comedy of Team selling but like also the fact of you have to know your stuff,39:30
because if you don't then a sea level all of a sudden is going to maybe see you as being less valuable,39:36
um how do you balance those two things or how do you make sure you're seen as a,39:42
valuable resource while also bringing the wider Team without having it Go poorly right or having the,39:47
c-suite maybe go around you like we talked about like what like how do you ensure that you're able to balance those,39:53
two things well hmm I'll jump in that I think coming to,39:58
conversations with really strong agendas is really important so if I'm getting on,40:05
the call and maybe we're discussing something slightly Technical and also a different topic making sure that you're,40:10
clearly delegating that out to someone else who's specifically um you know it's their job to be able to,40:17
speak about those things and laying that out from the get-go so it doesn't just seem like you know they've got the,40:24
technical topic and now they're having to jump in and save you because you didn't know what the answer was so I,40:29
think clearly laying out roles and responsibilities through your sales process is something really important so,40:35
that your buyer also maybe knows hey if there is something technical this is the best person for us to go to,40:40
I might just add the roles and responsibilities as laid out in a rehearsal like use like do pre-call prep,40:48
and invite all Partners to those those calls and and play that out,40:54
um you're gonna get caught by surprise sometimes that you strive not to but make sure you note down what those,40:59
questions are so you don't get caught by surprise next time but we talk about kind of striving for expertise and so,41:04
you have to find you're kind of your source of authority like you know you know your products and your customer experience you should know those better,41:10
than your buyer so at least have that down hat um but I totally agree that roles of,41:16
responsibilities are really important I think like to tack on to that I think,41:21
that explaining why you're bringing the individuals in when you're bringing them,41:27
in is helpful you know um because instead instead of just like having someone show up to a call run,41:32
that call for you or most of it for you if you explain why you're doing that that helps set the tone and I think,41:39
number two also explaining that assuming we end up in a partnership together these are individuals that you're going,41:45
to know or work with or their teams as our customer and this is the big I treat this as the beginning of the,41:52
relationship in sort of an assumptive sort of way um you know for us we'll we'll bring our,41:57
chief customer officer onto calls we bring his directors and managers onto,42:03
calls depending upon the type of deal that we're working on um our cro will jump onto calls because,42:08
we sell into sales teams and marketing teams and cros are you know big stakeholders in not only the purchase of,42:14
the deal but in making sure that all goes well once they're on board so I,42:22
sort of think of it like we haven't signed a contract yet but this is what it's like to work with us you get to know all of us and it's not just me,42:27
yeah and I think like if they can if they do think it's just you I think that can sometimes be a bit worrying for,42:35
buyers like why am I just working with this one person and no one else in the company cares about this so I think,42:40
you're also kind of giving reassurance to your buyer that like hey this is an important deal for us that's why we're,42:46
getting all of these people and experts involved in whatever their experts in so I think it kind of works both ways,42:52
totally and I think um you know to kind of summarize a lot of the points around,43:01
um the uh preparation being super important right so make sure you the roles responsibilities love that like,43:06
have have clear expectations for not only the customer for but for your team on what the value is that they're going,43:12
to bring as part of the deal um and then ultimately that's going to um that's going to allow you to kind of,43:18
really set the tone of the relationship early on and grow kind of your point around,43:25
um you know especially like mid-stage of the deal like you start getting closer to,43:30
um things being finalized you want the customer to feel like um you know hey this is the beginning of,43:35
something like we're not just focused on getting the deal done we're focused on driving the outcomes for you based on what we talked about we're going to go,43:41
out there and Achieve right based on X and so telling it back to Value I think is super important in team selling definitely helps you helps you do that,43:46
um so we got through um all the questions so thank you all,43:53
um and you know we've seen a lot come through the chat in the past uh in the past uh 45 minutes or so,43:59
um and so this is kind of like last if you have any any questions you want to be asking the group of panelists here on,44:07
how to sell the c-suite now is the time to uh put in the chat and we can kind of discuss it for a few minutes before we,44:13
wrap up with our key takeaways Evan I was laughing at Michael's question about have you seen executive,44:19
step in and say the wrong thing and mess up the deal yeah I've been like the senior product guy who comes on and I'm,44:26
like too quick to jump to a discount they're like shut up stop dude yeah I think it's funny,44:31
um you know going back to the appropriate for sure we've all seen that right I think there's an interesting,44:38
conversation around also uh titles and competency you know to your point and,44:43
sometimes you will find Executives maybe um you know you like just because,44:50
someone has a title doesn't necessarily mean maybe they understand the business as well as they should be those are things I think you have to vet for and,44:55
then the preparation side definitely resonates around um you know think about how many times,45:02
you've had that conversation you spent all signed prepping and you get in the conversation the sea level and it does not go at all according to plan right,45:07
like typically it's it's being hijacked in certain ways and so um uh I feel like we see that happen all,45:13
the time as well um but come in see cool any any final questions to my team,45:20
we're going to do a quick wrap um on key takeaways if there's nothing else from the people on chat we can kind,45:27
of get into that piece typo it's probably cool,45:34
um so Ted why don't we start with you um biggest takeaway from,45:40
the the conversation today in terms of how do you get in front of the c c faster,45:46
yeah I mean I like um I don't remember because Katie or broke your point on uh two to three,45:53
minute ask instead of the 30-minute ask um I don't know if that's something you would who always advise or if it's just,45:58
something that's more specific to this environment for those of us that are selling to tech companies we know they've been through pretty probably,46:04
pretty tough budget cycle in the last uh quarter or so and so just being you know empathetic of that situation,46:11
um you know for me I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about the role of indecision it plays and how we need to make sure,46:19
we're incorporating that when we're talking to buyers at all points of the decision process and addressing that,46:25
fear of messing up um you know is a really really important thing right now in today's sales,46:31
thank you I can go next oh sorry,46:39
all right my biggest takeaway like the thing that I heard the most across all the,46:45
questions and all of our insights and like looking at the chat is preparation you know like really being ready and,46:51
tight and thinking through you know what this call is for what this message is,46:59
for who am I reaching out to what's their reality like and what do they care about is going to get us further in both,47:04
booking meetings and closing deals and creating better experiences for the buyers that are involved in our,47:11
evaluations um but just thinking about the past 45 minutes that's the thing that came up,47:17
the most um yeah and I think to add to that as well I think just the need when you're,47:22
speaking specifically to the c-suite as well is just no fluff,47:29
um we've all kind of said it in different ways but you've just got to have um that agenda kind of nailed down super,47:34
tight no fluff straight to the point whether that be when you're either like on the phone or when you're emailing,47:41
them or whatever it may be um and also just making sure that you've got that Rapport so you're standing out,47:47
as a seller yeah I think those are all great takeaways I think for me uh big theme is,47:52
expectations and just thinking about expectations in terms of like how do you engage with the,48:01
sea level what can you realistically be asking for them um like the low ask,48:07
um thing I think is super important and then ultimately um you know how are they involved in your deal and just understanding that as,48:12
a seller I think is super important so that you can have the right buying process both externally and internally,48:18
um that aligns well with that to help that executive you know um you know make the right decision with,48:25
their team and so I think the expectations piece I think is super important around sales process when you,48:30
get a sea level involved I think just being realistic around that I think is is important to understand to make sure,48:36
that you're getting you're getting the most out of every interaction and preparing for that to make sure that,48:42
you're you continue to kind of move things move things forward you know I would and don't ask questions,48:47
you can Google yes whoever put that in the chat that's an amazing I feel like that's an amazing uh,48:54
we're all gonna steal that piece so I love that,49:01
cool um so we have some uh just to kind of wrap we do have a uh as we talked about,49:06
Drifters Host this webinar you know Brooke and myself are um both uh both work at drift and uh we,49:13
